      "This was not my first time visiting New York, let alone the city. In fact, this was probably my fifth or sixth visit to the state, however, it was my third visit to the city! While the trip was mostly to visit my family, my girlfriend and I managed to find two days in the week to explore the city on our own. The image you see is in front of the Apple store in Manhattan. I wanted to get a photo, as I used to work at the Apple Store!",

      "My time at Multnomah Falls was a wonderful time. Living in Portland, OR, for nearly all of my life, and never visited, has stunned people. Thus, it was time to visit, and boy was it worth it! Visiting in mid-September, the Summer was setting and the Fall season was kicking in. Therefore, the temperature, views, and atmosphere was perfect. I plan to visit again!",
